\section{Status and Outlook}


Our website is a new project, having been deployed very recently at \url{http://gamma-sky.net} in early June 2016. The current content of \gammasky is simply a starting point; we have plans to greatly expand on our catalog and image data. Such data includes additional image surveys from CDS' HiPS database, as well as data from upcoming surveys upon their public release. The Fermi high-energy images are among the images we will prepare with HiPS for display on the Map View. We additionally strive to enhance the user interface of \gammasky through additional features, including new source groupings by classification as done in NASA's Fermi-LAT 3FGL Catalog Interactive Table\footnote[6]{\url{http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/4yr_catalog/3FGL-table}} and more intricate data panels for the Catalog View. Using Angular 2, an improved routing network will be implemented  to allow for sharing a specific view in the Map View page by URL. We will continue to point directly to Gammapy scripts for any further analysis and keep server-heavy tools off our website.
