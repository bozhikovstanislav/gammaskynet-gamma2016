Our website is a new project, having been deployed very recently at \url{http://gamma-sky.net} in early June 2016. The website is being hosted by GitHub Pages. The current content of \gammasky is simply a starting point; we have plans to greatly expand on our catalog and image data. Such data includes additional image surveys from CDS' HiPS database, as well as source and image data from upcoming surveys upon their public release. We additionally strive to enhance the user interface of \gammasky through additional features - including new source groupings by classification and position, deeper communication between the Map View and Catalog View, and more intricate data panels for the Catalog View. We will continue to point to Gammapy for any further analysis, and we strive to link our website more closely to Gammapy's tools and scripts in the future.
