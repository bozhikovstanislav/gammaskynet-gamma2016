\section{Status and Outlook}


Our website is a new project, having been deployed very recently at \url{http://gamma-sky.net} in early June 2016. The website is being hosted by GitHub Pages. The current content of \gammasky is simply a starting point; we have plans to greatly expand on our catalog and image data. Such data includes additional image surveys from CDS' HiPS database, as well as source and image data from upcoming surveys upon their public release. We additionally strive to enhance the user interface of \gammasky through additional features, including new source groupings by classification as done in NASA's Fermi-LAT 3FGL Catalog Interactive Table\footnote[5]{\url{http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/4yr_catalog/3FGL-table}}, improved routing between the Map View and the Catalog View, and more intricate data panels for the Catalog View. We will continue to point directly to Gammapy scripts for any further analysis and keep server-heavy tools off our website.
