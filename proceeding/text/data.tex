    The default survey image displayed on gamma-sky.net's Map View page is a multi-wavelength all-sky survey from Fermi-LAT. In its native color map, sources are assigned certain colors according to their determined energies - red/yellow at 300-1000 MeV; green at 1-3 GeV; and blue at 3-300 GeV. The Fermi color image was distributed by NASA's SkyView Virtual Observatory and is stored as a ``Heirarchical Progressive Survey" (HiPS) image. HiPS is a heirarchical data structure utilizing the HEALPix tesselation of a sphere that organizes data onto pixelated tiles of scalable resolution. The HiPS image mechanism allows catalog data on gamma-sky.net to be visualized accurately on the sky map at various zoom levels. HiPS was developed under the Centre de Donn\'{e}es astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS). gamma-sky.net currently encompasses 8 survey images prepared in HiPS format, as illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:images}. All of the images come from the CDS's HiPS database, containing a total of over 300 HiPS images.

    Our website incorporates 4 catalogs, which are displayed in Table~\ref{tab:catalogs}. 3FGL and 2FHL are the latest surveys from Fermi-LAT, which is the main space-based instrument we display sources from. SNRcat is an up-to-date compilation of galactic SNRs observed from a variety of instruments. The database is maintained by the University of Manitoba and can be accessed at \url{http://www.physics.umanitoba.ca/snr/SNRcat/}. gamma-cat is an open-data catalog of sources in the TeV range. As a project that has just recently begun in early September 2016, it is undergrowing rapid growth and will be updated frequently on gamma-sky.net. gamma-cat was started at the Max-Planck-Institut f\'{u}r Kernphysik (MPIK), but is open to contribution from other developers. All of the catalog information can be found at \url{https://gammapy.github.io/gamma-cat/}.

    User inputs for search fields under the Map View portion of the website are interpreted by the Sesame service. Sesame is a search term resolver for astronomical objects which queries several databases and returns the resolved sources. Both Sesame and the databases searched (Simbad, NED, and VizieR) are maintained by CDS.

    Under the Catalog View of gamma-sky.net, we are currently borrowing 3FGL light curve and emission spectrum plots from NASA's Fermi-LAT 3FGL Interactive Table, which can be accessed at \url{http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/4yr_catalog/3FGL-table}.
