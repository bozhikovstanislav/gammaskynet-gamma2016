\begin{itemize}

\item Evolution of VHE gamma-ray astronomy - increasing number of detections, novel Cherenkov telescope arrays (especially CTA)

\item Upcoming surveys like HGPS (by MPIK) - clearer resolution than our current surveys

\item Because of an increasing interest in the field, there is a need for a hub of VHE data (GeV, TeV) across many different catalogs.
This is what gamma-sky.net was created for.

\end{itemize}
