\section{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank CDS (Centre de Donn\'{e}es astronomiques de Strasbourg) for developing the data formats (HiPS) and tools (Aladin Lite) that make \gammasky possible. Thomas~Boch helped us configure Aladin Lite to our use case. We would also like to thank: GitHub for hosting our website; CDS for serving the HiPS images; and all of the contributors to the open-source projects, including Angular 2, Astropy, and Gammapy, that we have used to build \gammasky.
