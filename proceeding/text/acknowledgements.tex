\section{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank the CDS (Centre de Donn\'{e}es astronomiques de Strasbourg) for developing the data formats (HIPS) and tools (Aladin Lite)
that make gamma-sky.net possible. Thomas~Boch helped us to understand Aladin Lite and apply it to our use case.

We would also like to thank Github for hosting the gamma-sky.net website,
and CDS for serving the HIPS images, as well as the people that have contributed to the open-source projects we use to build gamma-sky.net: the angular web framework as well as the Astropy and Gammapy Python packages.
