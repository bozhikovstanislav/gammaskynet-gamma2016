\section{Implementation}

Scientific Python packages Astropy \cite{astropy} and Gammapy \cite{gammapy} were used to prepare and generate all of the catalog and source data on gamma-sky.net. The data is consumed with the JavaScript and HTML front-end. The website's architecture was organized using Angular 2, a modern web application framework for JavaScript. Using Angular 2 has allowed us to compile gamma-sky.net into a single-page application. The sphere interface and visualization was implemented using the Aladin Lite tool \cite{aladin-lite} developed at CDS.
