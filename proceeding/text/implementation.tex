\section{Implementation}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Gammapy, Astropy used to generate catalog data (and map data)
% \item Data consumed with JS and HTML
% \item Website architecture built with Angular 2 as a single-page app
% \item Sphere interface and maps overlay by Aladin Lite tool
% \end{itemize}


    Scientific Python packages Astropy and Gammapy \cite{gammapy} were used to prepare and generate all of the catalog and source data on gamma-sky.net. The data is consumed with the JavaScript and HTML frontend. The website's architecture was organized using Angular 2, a modern web application framework for JavaScript. Using Angular 2 has allowed us to compile gamma-sky.net into a single-page application. The sphere interface and visualization was implemented using the Aladin Lite tool \cite{aladin-lite} developed at CDS.


    TODO: Explain/mention Gammapy in more detail?
