\section{Idea}

\gammasky is a one-stop resource for browsing images and catalogs but also for closely examining a specific gamma-ray source. Although it was mainly built for the greater astronomical community, the webpage additionally targets the general public through a user-friendly interface and a clean information layout, all of which are compiled under cutting-edge web tools.

The pop-up for one TeV source is displayed, as well as the toolbar on the side containing widgets for controlling the map overlays.}

Individuals who access \url{http://gamma-sky.net} via any modern internet browser will be welcomed with the Map View homepage. This page displays overlays of multi-wavelength survey images, most of which are all-sky, wrapped around a three-dimensional sphere. Gamma-ray sources from our catalog data have then been pinpointed onto the sphere, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mapview}. The map features pan-and-zoom functionality for easily navigating and quickly browsing the sky. The Map View page also utilizes a powerful search tool to either pan the view to a given sky position or locate a source by name. This functionality is intended to work similar to Google Maps\footnote[1]{https://www.google.com/maps}, and allows the user to easily find sources of interest and study their visual context. See Table~\ref{tab:images} for our selection of images on the website and Table~\ref{tab:catalogs} for the catalogs we display. \gammasky additionally embodies a Catalog View, which incorporates more detailed information for each of the sources in our catalogs. Professional astronomers will navigate to this component of the website for the deep investigation of a particular source. The Catalog View page is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:catview}.

\gammasky aims to be a resource for examining a source or region; however, any tools for extended analysis will not be incorporated into the website. Instead for such continued investigation, we point users to Gammapy \cite{gammapy}, a Python package for gamma-ray astronomy, which can used to run scripts locally. These scripts will generate the detailed plots and publication-worthy results that astronomers are interested in. Alternatively, users may navigate to TeVCat \cite{tevcat} for investigating TeV sources, or the ASI Science Data Center (ASDC) website for their online tools (e.g. ASDC Data Explorer\footnote[2]{http://www.asdc.asi.it/tutorial/DataExplorer/DataExplorerTutorial.html}, SED Builder\footnote[3]{http://www.asdc.asi.it/tutorial/SEDBuilder/SEDBuilderTutorial.html}) and their TeGeV Catalogue for TeV sources \cite{tgevcat}.


It is imperative for all of our data on the online portal to be openly available for download and local analysis by any user. Additionally, the website is an entirely open-source project, and other developers are welcome to contribute to the code. We advise those interested in contributing to visit our GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-sky}.
