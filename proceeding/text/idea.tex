\section{Idea}

\begin{itemize}

\item Interactive website designed for exploring the gamma-ray sky

\item Survey images of different frequency bands (mainly all-sky) overlaid onto a three-dimensional map. Gamma-ray sources from catalog data are pinpointed onto the map.

\item The website facilitates both quick browsing and deep investigation of sources

\item Understand the context of sources by viewing them on the map

\item Easily compare sources from different catalogs

\item Website targets professional astronomers, but also the general public through
a user-friendly interface and the easily understandable layout of sources plotted over a map.

\item Open source, open data - allows for 1. users to download any data from our website, and 2. for other developers to contribute to the code.

\end{itemize}
