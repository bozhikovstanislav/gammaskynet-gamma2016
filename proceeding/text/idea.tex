\section{Idea}

\begin{itemize}

\item Interactive website designed for exploring the gamma-ray sky

\item Survey images of different frequency bands (mainly all-sky) overlaid onto a three-dimensional map. Gamma-ray sources from catalog data are pinpointed onto the map.

\item The website facilitates both quick browsing and deep investigation of sources

\item Understand the context of sources by viewing them on the map

\item Easily compare sources from different catalogs

\item Website targets professional astronomers, but also the general public through
a user-friendly interface and the easily understandable layout of sources plotted over a map.

\item Open source, open data - allows for 1. users to download any data from our website, and 2. for other developers to contribute to the code.

\end{itemize}


    gamma-sky.net is a one-stop resource for perusing images and catalogs but also closely examining a specific gamma-ray source.
    Although it was mainly built for the astronomical community, the webpage also targets the general public through a
    user-friendly interface and a clean information layout, all of which is compiled under cutting-edge web tools.

    Individuals who access the website via any modern internet browser will be welcomed with the Map View page.
    This page presents an overlay of multi-wavelength survey images, most of which are all-sky images, wrapped around a three-dimensional sphere.
    The map features pan-and-zoom functionality for easily navigating and quickly browsing the sky. Gamma-ray sources from
    our catalog data have been pinpointed onto the sphere, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mapview}. The map also utilizes a powerful search tool to either pan the view to a given sky position or locate a specific source by name. These features allow the user to easily find their sources and study their visual context in relation to other objects.
    gamma-sky.net additionally embodies a Catalog View, which incorporates more detailed information for each of the sources in our catalogs.
    Professional astronomers will navigate to this component of the website for the deep investigation of a particular source.
    See Figure~\ref{fig:catview} for the catalog view.

    It is imperative for all of our data on the online portal to be openly available for download and local analysis by any user. Additionally, gamma-sky.net is an open-source project and other developers are welcome to contribute to the code. We advise those interested in contributing to visit our Github repository at \url{https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-sky}.
