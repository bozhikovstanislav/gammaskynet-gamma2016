gamma-sky.net: Portal to the Gamma-Ray Sky
==========================================

Authors: Arjun Voruganti, Christoph Deil, Axel Donath, Johannes King

gamma-sky.net is a novel interactive website designed for exploring the gamma-ray sky, 
targeting both practitioners of astronomy and the general public alike. Our poster displays the 
content of our online portal, featuring high-energy survey images and catalog information using 
data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT).  Users can interact with the archive 
through a pan-and-zoom feature and powerful search tools. As the field of gamma-ray astronomy 
develops, we plan on expanding the website with more publicly available gamma-ray data, 
including High Energy Spectroscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Galactic Plane Survey maps (upon their 
public release) and survey images from the Planck satellite. Along with enriching our database, 
we also aim to make available to the user additional engaging and resourceful tools, such as a 
display of spectral information. The website is being developed as an open-source, open-data 
project at https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-sky. Feedback and contributions are very 
welcome!
